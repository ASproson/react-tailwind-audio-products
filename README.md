# React Tailwind Audio Products

Hello there! This is a project to demonstrate my skills with React and Tailwind CSS. The original inspiration for this project comes from [FrontEndPractice.com](https://www.frontendpractice.com/projects/ableton). The website is super awesome and many thanks to the kind people behind it. 

For this repo I'm specifically focusing on the [Ableton reference image](https://www.frontendpractice.com/_next/image?url=%2Ffullsize%2FC1-Ableton.jpg&w=1920&q=90), but will be making use of different stock images and branding. 

## Installation

> git clone https://github.com/ASproson/react-tailwind-audio-products.git

Alternatively, a live link will be available soon
